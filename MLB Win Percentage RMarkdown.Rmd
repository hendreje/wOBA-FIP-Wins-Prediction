<h1 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h1>


In 2013, MLB baseball saw the Boston Red Sox win their third World Series in 10 seasons over the St. Louis Cardinals with David Ortiz taking home World Series MVP honors. No one, was really shocked by these two teams making it to the World Series. They were head and shoulders better than the majority of their respective leagues truly dominated all the way to the World Series. These two teams we great on the field and but with seemingly large gap in funding, Boston at 150+ Million and St.Louis at 92 Million. 

The premise of this analysis is to understand if we can predict the number of wins a team recorded based on a teams runs scored, runs allowed, payroll, weighted on-base-average (wOBA), and fielding independent pitching (FIP). In theory, payroll enables teams to purchase the best players and the best players should be able to score the most runs while giving up the fewest. Those expected win totals will give us an understanding of the teams that should have made the playoffs in 2013 based on the number of runs they scored versus the number of runs given up. Additionally, we will look to see if advanced metrics such as wOBA and FIP can explain an of the variation we observe with a teams win total.

```
For everyone's knowledge, in 2013, 10 teams made it to the Major League Postseason. The Boston Red Sox, Oakland Atheletics, Detroit Tigers, Cleveland Indian, and Tampa Bay Rays represented the American League. In the National League the St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cincinnati Reds made the playoffs. In Major League Baseball, three teams in each league gain a playoff spot by winning their division, the other two spots are filled with the next highest records of a given team. So, if a team had 82 wins and led their division they would be in the playoffs over a team that may have won 89 games and finished 4th in another division

<h4 style="text-align: left;">Sean Lahman's Major League Baseball Statistic Descriptions</h4>
Lahman's "Salaries" data frame highlights and summarizes the payroll of each team in 2013 and the players which team paid and how much they were paid for that season. For this analysis, we were not interested in individual pay, only the sum of what each team spent in 2013. Therefore, we will remove players names, IDs, and individual salaries from the table. 

Lahman's "Teams" data frame highlights and summaries each team's wins, losses, runs scored, runs allowed, and playoff win statistics. These columns will be used to help us predict future win totals and see if our model is statistically significant and accurate at predicting playoff teams. 

Lahman's "Batting" data frame highlights and summarizes the the team batting statistics of each team in 2013. For this analysis, we were not interested in individual pitching performance, only the sum of how each team performed in 2013. 

Lahman's "Pitching" data frame highlights and summarizes the the team pitching statistics of each team in 2013. For this analysis, we were not interested in individual pitching performance, only the sum of how each team performed in 2013.

<h1 style="text-align: left;">Modeling</h1>
Now that we have gathered all of our data, made the proper modifications needed to analysis our data, lets dig into some modeling. First, I was interesting in seeing if there was any kind of relationship with FIP and wOBA on a team or even league level. In the graph below, we see that teh American League appears to have a grouping of teams that are high when it comes to wOBA compared to their National League counterparts. However, I dont believe this graph really tells us much, since all of the points are scattered across with no particular order. So lets progress to the next exploratory model. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold'}
phi <- ggplot(Data, aes(x=TEAMFIP, y=TEAMwOBA, size=Payroll, color=lgID)) + geom_point() 
phi + 
  labs(
  title = "2013 MLB Team Average wBOA vs. FIP",
  x = "Team: Fielding Independent Pitching",
  y = "Team: Weighted On-Base Average"
) + facet_grid() + theme_gray()

omega <- ggplot(Data, aes(x=W, y=Payroll, color = factor(lgID))) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
omega + labs(
       title = "2013 MLB Teams vs Total Payroll", 
       x = "Actual Wins by Team",
       y = "Total Payroll by Team", 
       color = "League") + 
  facet_grid() + theme_gray()
```
The second thing I wanted to observe is if there is a visual relationship between wins and payroll. For a long-time Major League Baseball has not had an established salary cap. Meaning, teams can spend as much or as little as they would like on their team's payroll for a given season. This has the perception by many fans to be an 'unfair advantage' by the wealthy owners and their teams. However, as we can observe below, at least within the 2013 season, the disparity between the teams who spent a large amount (over 120MM) and those who did not is rather significant. We do not see a large numbers of the teams who spent a significant amount of money in 2013 making it into the playoffs as opposed to teams who spent below that threshold. Therefore, I would say payroll would not have a significant effect on wins, from a visual sense, but we will confirm that with our model later on. 

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.show='hold', figures-side}
# Creating graph to explore possible relationship of Wins and FIP
tau <- ggplot(Data, aes(x=W, y=TEAMFIP, size=Payroll, color=lgID)) + geom_point() 
tau + 
  labs(
    title = "2013 MLB Team Wins vs. FIP",
    x = "Team Wins",
    y = "Team: Fielding Independent Pitching"
  ) + facet_grid() + theme_gray()

# Creating graph to explore possible relationship of Wins and FIP
nu <- ggplot(Data, aes(x=W, y=TEAMwOBA, size=Payroll, color=lgID)) + geom_point() 
nu + 
  labs(
    title = "2013 MLB Team Wins vs. wOBA",
    x = "Team Wins",
    y = "Team: Weighted On-Base Average"
  ) + facet_grid() + theme_gray()
```

Lastly, I wanted to observe if we predicted a means expected win percentage versus their actual wins earned, would we see a highly positive relationship. We can only assume that a team with a lot of wins scored significantly more runs than they gave up, but just to make sure we are correct in this assumption, lets test it. Within our model, we can see that a expected wins by team and actual wins have a highly positive relationship and that the majority of teams that scored more runs than surrendered to the other team, did in fact win games at a higher rate. Now that we understand what kind of varialbles we believe who have some relationship to wins, lets do some regression testing.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width="60%"}
theta <- ggplot(Data, aes(x=W, y=EWins, color=Payroll)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = 'lm')
theta + scale_color_gradient(low="red", high="green") + 
  labs(title = "2013 MLB Season Team Wins vs. Expected Wins",
       x = "Actual Wins by Team",
       y = "Expected Wins by Team") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Team Payroll")) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
