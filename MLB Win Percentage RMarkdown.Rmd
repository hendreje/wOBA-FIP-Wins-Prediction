<h1 style="text-align: left;">Introduction</h1>


In 2013, MLB baseball saw the Boston Red Sox win their third World Series in 10 seasons over the St. Louis Cardinals with David Ortiz taking home World Series MVP honors. No one, was really shocked by these two teams making it to the World Series. They were head and shoulders better than the majority of their respective leagues truly dominated all the way to the World Series. These two teams we great on the field and but with seemingly large gap in funding, Boston at 150+ Million and St.Louis at 92 Million. 

The premise of this analysis is to understand if we can predict wins and losses based on a teams runs scored, runs allowed, and payroll. In theory, payroll enables teams to purchase the best players and the best players should be able to score the most runs while giving up the fewest. Those expected win totals will give us an understanding of the teams that should have made the playoffs in 2013 based on the number of runs they scored versus the number of runs given up. We will then see if our model is accurate by evaluating those number of correct observations vs total observations.

For everyone's knowledge, in 2013, 10 teams made it to the Major League Postseason. The Boston Red Sox, Oakland Atheletics, Detroit Tigers, Cleveland Indian, and Tampa Bay Rays represented the American League. In the National League the St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Cincinnati Reds made the playoffs. In Major League Baseball, three teams in each league gain a playoff spot by winning their division, the other two spots are filled with the next highest records of a given team. So, if a team had 82 wins and led their division they would be in the playoffs over a team that may have won 89 games and finished 4th in another division

## Creating Dataframes
```{r,echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, message=FALSE}
#Loading in the salaries of each team for the 2013 Season
S <- Salaries %>% 
  select(yearID,teamID,lgID,playerID,salary) %>%
  filter(yearID==2013) %>%
  group_by(teamID) %>%
  mutate(Payroll = sum(salary))
  
#Loading in the general statistics of each team for the 2013 Season
T <- Teams %>% 
  select(yearID,lgID,teamID,W,L,R,RA) %>%
  filter(yearID==2013) %>%
  group_by(teamID)

#Loading in individual batting statistics for the 2013 Season
B <- Batting %>% 
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,AB,R,H,X2B,X3B,HR,BB,IBB,HBP,SF)%>%
  filter(yearID==2013) %>%
  filter(AB >= 35) %>%
  mutate(
    wOBA = (((0.69*BB) + (0.719*HBP) + (0.87*H) + (1.217*X2B) + (1.529*X3B) + (1.94*HR)) 
            /  (AB+BB+IBB+SF+HBP))) %>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,wOBA)

B <- B %>%
  group_by(teamID)%>%
  summarize(wOBA = mean(wOBA, na.rm=TRUE))

#Loading in individual pitching statistics for the 2013 Season
P <- Pitching %>% 
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,HR,BB,HBP,SO,IPouts) %>%
  filter(yearID==2013)%>%
  filter(IPouts >= 60) %>%
  mutate(IP = IPouts/3) %>%
  mutate(FIP = ((HR*13 + 3*(BB+HBP) - 2*SO) / 
                  IP + 3.2)) %>%
  select(playerID,yearID,teamID,FIP,IP)

P <- P %>%
  group_by(teamID)%>%
  summarize(FIP=mean(FIP, na.rm=TRUE))

#Merge Salaries and Teams Dataframes by Teamid, Yearid, and Leagueid to create 
#One Dataframe for analysis
df <- merge(S, T, by = c("teamID", "yearID", "lgID"))
df <- left_join(df,B, by = c("teamID"), na_matches="never")
df <- left_join(df,P,by = c("teamID"), na_matches="never")

#Removing duplicate observations for one observation per team
df2 <- subset(df, !duplicated(df$teamID))

#Selecting need columns for analysis
df2 <- df2 %>% select(teamID,lgID,Payroll,W,L,R,RA,wOBA,FIP)

Data <- df2 %>% 
  mutate(EWP=round(R/(R+RA), 4), EWins=EWP*(W+L), WinDiff=round(EWins-W))

<h3 style="text-align: left;">2013 MLB Salaries Table</h3>
Table highlights and summarizes the the payroll of each team in 2013 and the players which team paid and how much they were paid for that season. For this analysis, we were not interested in individual pay, only the sum of what each team spent in 2013. Therefore, we will remove players names, IDs, and individual salaries from the table. 

<h3 style="text-align: left;">2013 MLB Team Statistics Table</h3>
Table highlights and summaries each team's wins, losses, runs scored, runs allowed, and playoff win statistics. These columns will be used to help us predict future win totals and see if our model is statistically significant and accurate at predicting playoff teams. 

<h3 style="text-align: left;">2013 MLB Team Batting Table</h3>
Table highlights and summarizes the the team Batting Statistics of each team in 2013 and the players which team paid and how much they were paid for that season. For this analysis, we were not interested in individual pitching performance, only the sum of how each team performed in 2013. 

<h3 style="text-align: left;">2013 MLB Team Pitching Table</h3>
Table highlights and summarizes the the team Pitching Statistics of each team in 2013. For this analysis, we were not interested in individual pitching performance, only the sum of how each team performed in 2013.
